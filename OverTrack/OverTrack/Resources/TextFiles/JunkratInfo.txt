FRAG LAUNCHER|FRAG LAUNCHER|Junkrat's Frag Launcher lobs grenades a significant distance. They bounce to reach their destination, and blow up when they strike an enemy.
CONCUSSION MINE|CONCUSSION MINE|After placing one of his homemade Concussion Mines, Junkrat can trigger it to damage enemies and send them flying... or propel himself through the air.
STEEL TRAP|STEEL TRAP|Junkrat tosses out a giant, metal-toothed trap. Should an enemy wander too close to the trap, it clamps on, injuring and immobilizing them.
TOTAL MAYHEM|TOTAL MAYHEM|Junkrat's deranged sense of humor persists past his death. If killed, he drops several live grenades.
RIP-TIRE|RIP-TIRE|Junkrat revs up a motorized tire bomb and sends it rolling across the battlefield, climbing over walls and obstacles. He can remotely detonate the RIP-Tire to deal serious damage to enemies caught in the blast, or just wait for it to explode on its own.
